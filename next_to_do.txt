ABCI / Application Wiring: hook consensus to an application state machine, run DeliverTx/Commit, and validate proposals against app results (e.g., via block ID, app hash).
Validator Identity & Signatures: give each validator its own keypair, sign votes and proposals, attach signatures to commits, and verify them on receipt.
Evidence Handling: persist evidence, gossip it, and enforce penalties (jailed/tombstoned validators can’t propose or vote until slashed).
State Persistence: store locked/valid blocks, round info, and validator sets on disk so restarts resume correctly.
Networking: replace the in‑process simulator with a real P2P stack (handshakes, peer discovery, gossip, backpressure, misbehaving-peer handling).
Timeout & Round Logic: match Tendermint’s precise exponential timeout schedule, round-change messages, and proposer selection rules.
Block Structure & Validation: include transaction data, Merkle hashes, commit sig arrays; run proposer/client-side checks (e.g., vote extensions, commit counts).
Configuration & Telemetry: expose config files/CLI for validator keys, addresses, timeouts; add structured logging and metrics.
